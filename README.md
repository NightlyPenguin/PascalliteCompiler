# PacalCompiler

The finals Project for Algorithms and Compilers class (CS 4301):
    
    stage1.h file is the helper file that contains variables, functions, and routines
    
    stage1Main.C the main file used to run the program.

Both stage1.h and Stage1Main.C were provided by the professor to help create our pascal compiler that is written using C++

The stage11.cpp files contains the overall compiler structure. With the way, the class was set up, we were only allowed to submit one file with all the code,
    which is why all functions are crammed into the .cpp file.
